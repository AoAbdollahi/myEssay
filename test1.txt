It is important in education today that students know how to write a five paragraph essay.  Most five paragraph essays include an introduction like this one, as well as three body paragraphs and a conclusion.  Each body paragraph argues a different point.  The first body paragraph argues the strongest point, the second boy paragraph argues the second strongest point and the third body paragraph argues the weakest point.  The conclusion ends the essay, and restates the thesis which belongs here.
